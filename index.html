            <h2>What is a Chaos Draft?</h2>
        
            <h3>A Magic: The Gathering Phenomenom</h3>
            <p>Chaos Draft in Magic: The Gathering began as a fan-made format where players mixed random booster packs from different sets to create unpredictable draft experiences. Its popularity grew over time, and Wizards of the Coast officially supported it at events like Magic Online and Grand Prix tournaments. <br>
            <br>    
            Chaos Drafting is a fun and unpredictable way to play Magic: The Gathering where you can build decks from a wildly mixed pool of cards. Instead of drafting from a single set or block, each booster pack comes from a completely different Magic set, often spanning decades of card history. This creates chaotic and surprising combinations, as cards that normally wouldn’t interact end up in the same draft. The result is a highly creative and entertaining draft experience, testing players’ deck-building skills and adaptability in unique ways. Chaos Drafts are popular for casual play and special events, offering a fresh twist on the traditional draft format.</p>
